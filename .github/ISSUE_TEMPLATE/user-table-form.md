> It counts a reputation point for each good task on the open Internet/computing.
> If you want to verify a ZeroNet user, post a issue here with this template. For preventing frauds with multiplication of points, you can send only 1 point for each 2 points received. If you have 5 points and already sent 2 points, you can't send more points until you receive more 2 points. Points you can give, are called sPoints.
